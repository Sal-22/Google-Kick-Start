# Google-Kick-Start
codes for google's kick start coding rounds that run all year round

I'll be adding codes for new and previous kick start challenges that are meant to help people understand the challenges and get a coding hand-on from my perspective. It might take time but I like the kick-start challenges, and hopefully this will bring a tiny bit more people interested in that. 

the getchar_unlocked() method for input output that I use can be understood more from [this site](http://abhisharlives.blogspot.com/2012/06/really-fast-io-methods-for-programming.html) and some basic tips from read me section of [this repository](https://github.com/parikshit223933/Coding-Ninjas-Competitive-Programming#readme) which helped me understand codes when I was in the learning stage
