# Google-Kick-Start
codes for google's kick start coding rounds that run all year round

past years as well as the most recent rounds, all of them are available at google's official [kick start archive](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/archive/) page. You can access the problems by choosing the year, then 'view' and then 'open problem'.

I'll be adding codes for new and previous kick start challenges that are meant to help people understand the challenges and get a coding hand-on from my perspective. It might take time but I like the kick-start challenges, and hopefully this will bring a tiny bit more people interested in that. 


#Feel free to suggest changes for optimization or faster execution of code through pull requests <3
or make a new file and use pull request if it's a completely different method of execution compared to the one I post.

the getchar_unlocked() method for input output that I use can be understood more from [this site](http://abhisharlives.blogspot.com/2012/06/really-fast-io-methods-for-programming.html) and some basic tips from read me section of [this github repository](https://github.com/parikshit223933/Coding-Ninjas-Competitive-Programming#readme) which helped me understand codes when I was in the learning stage
